<h1 >transformer</h1>
<p >transformer is a static electrical device which transfer electrical power from one circuit to 
another circuit with out changing frequency and it increase voltage and current secondry 
and vice versa decreases</p>
<h2 >dc motor</h2>
<div> dc motor is a energy conversion device which convert electrical energy to mechanical energy
its works on based of lorentz principle is nothing but current carring conductor placed inside 
magnetic field force or torque and the direction of torque based on flemings lefthand rule</div>
<h3 >dc generator</h3>
<p >dc generator is a energy conversion device which convert mechanical energy to electrical energy 
it is working based on faradays law of dynamicallly induced emf when ever a coil or conductor rotate
inside magnetic field emf will be induced in it the direction of induced emf based on flemings right hand
rule .</p>
<h4>induction motor</h4>
<div >hen ever three phase supply given to stator there is a rotational magenetic field created
which rotate in synchronous speed . at that time rotor at stand still condition accroding to 
faradays law of electro magnetic induction there is emf induced in rotor accroding to lenzs law
rotor starts to rotate</div>
